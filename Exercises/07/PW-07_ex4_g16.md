# Exercise 4: [Inception-v4 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261)

The authors introduce residual connections as seen in ResNet into the Inception
architecture.

Inception-v4 is the third successor to GoogLeNet (also known as Incpetion-v1).

Compared to ResNet batch normalization is used in fewer places to lower memory
usage and therefore be able to increase the number of Inception blocks.

Their findings show that introducing residual connections does not increase the
recognition performance of the model. It does however greatly improve training
speed.
